			<p>
			I have always been tech-savvy. Since I was in Elementary school, I was playing around with html/css for my blogs. Upon becoming
			math teacher, I had to take a coding class and really enjoyed the problem solving. When I got my teaching credentials, I
			decided that my next step was to become a tenured teacher and then help create an educational game that is actually fun.
			I am not tenured yet, but my desires to make learning fun is still strong. I also discovered that I really miss the struggle
			of problem solving. I really like math and that is why I became a math teacher. I also really like the aspect of math of
			using everything you know and thinking outside the box to solve a problem.
			</p>

			<p>
			A hobby of mine is playing games! Not only that but the logic behind building a functional game is entertaining to me. Building a 
			game (such as the KPOP game in my portfolio) was so fun that it was a game within a game for me. My current favorite game is Overwatch.
			It is my current classroom theme and my students love it!
